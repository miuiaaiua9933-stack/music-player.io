I feel your light behind closed eyes
The quiet hum of dreams untold
Wraps my heart in gentle gold
Softly falls the midnight air
Echoes whisper, you are there
Every sigh and silent plea
Stay with me through fading light
Guide me softly through the night
When the dawn begins to glow
Your love will lead me home, I know
Through the calm and through the rain
Every loss becomes your name
In the dark, your voice remains
Calling me to dream again
