Even if the dream is far away
I still remember your childhood smile
Sheltered days, just laughing free
Those memories are still alive in me
Some nights the tears begin to fall
Holding my breath, I hide it all
But someone’s kindness, soft and near
Lights a quiet flame, makes it clear
Hand in hand, let’s walk tonight
I know the glow that lives inside
A treasure chest, it’s all within
With love, it turns to light again
