Dreams are still so far away
But I recall your smile that day
Safe and warm, just laughing free
Those gentle times still live in me
Tears may fall on quiet nights
When the weight is hard to hide
But a touch of kindness near
Always lights the dark with clear
The world is fragile, wide, and cold
But this sweet miracle I hold
Even if it hurts, I’ll try
One more step with you, tonight
